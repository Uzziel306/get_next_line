I have often used those three terms almost interchangeably, yes, even computer scientist. After all, most of us
have a degree in computer science, so what does that make us? However, recently I find that those three things
have come to take on more and more distinct personalities in my mind. It has come to the point where if I think
about someone I know - or know of - within the industry, they immediately fall into one of those three categories.
Which is not to say that one person can't have attributes from all three, but regardless, they always tend to
favor one most strongly and so I fit them into that category, programmer, developer or computer scientist.
